    <p>These caramel apple cinnamon rolls are fluffy cinnamon rolls amped up with a sweet apple and caramel filling. Serve them with a drizzle of warmed caramel sauce.</p>

    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>3/4 cup whole milk</p></li>
        <li><p>1/4 cup water</p></li>
        <li><p>4 cups bread flour or all-purpose flour</p></li>
        <li><p>1/3 cup white sugar</p></li>
        <li><p>1 (0.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</p></li>
        <li><p>1 teaspoon salt</p></li>
        <li><p>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</p></li>
        <li><p>1/3 cup butter, melted</p></li>
        <li><p>2/3 cup packed brown sugar</p></li>
        <li><p>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</p></li>
        <li><p>2/3 cup high-quality caramel sauce, such as Mrs. Richardson's®, warmed, plus 1/2 cup for drizzling</p></li>
        <li><p>1 apple, peeled and finely chopped</p></li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Directions -->
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Stir together milk and water in a glass measuring cup. Microwave mixture until it reaches 105 to 115 degrees F (40 to 46 degrees C), 30 to 60 seconds.</p></li>
        <li><p>Whisk together 2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add eggs, melted butter, and milk mixture. Beat at low speed until combined. Beat at high speed 15 seconds. Switch to dough hook attachment. Add remaining 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing until a soft dough forms and begins to pull away from sides of bowl, 3 to 5 minutes—dough will be sticky. Transfer dough to a lightly greased bowl, turning to coat. Chill, covered, until dough is easy to handle, at least 2 hours or up to overnight.</p></li>
        <li><p>Grease 2 (9 inch) round cake pans or 2 (8 inch) square baking pans. Stir together brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; set aside. Punch down dough. Divide dough in half. Roll one portion of dough on a lightly floured surface into a 6x16-inch rectangle. If dough springs back when rolling, cover and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes, then try rolling again. Spread 1/3 cup caramel sauce over rolled-out dough portion; sprinkle with half the cinnamon-sugar and apples.</p></li>
        <li><p>Starting on a long side, roll up dough to form a log; pinch seam to seal. Slice dough log into 8 (2-inch-thick) pieces. Put rolls, cut sides down, in one of the prepared pans. Repeat with remaining dough, 1/3 cup caramel sauce, cinnamon-sugar, and apples. Let rolls rise, covered, in a warm place until nearly double in size, about 30 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 24 minutes. Cool in pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Drizzle rolls with 1/2 cup caramel sauce and serve warm.</p></li>
    </ol>
