    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>2 pounds sirloin tips, cubed</p></li>
        <li><p>1/2 yellow onion, chopped</p></li>
        <li><p>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup (such as Campbellâ€™s)</p></li>

    <!-- Directions -->
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute beef sirloin tips with onion in the hot skillet until beef is browned, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir cream of mushroom soup, milk, red wine, and beef with onion soup mix together in a bowl, pour into the skillet, and stir to coat beef in the soup mixture; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, place a cover on the skillet, and cook until the beef tips are tender, about 2 hours.</p></li>
